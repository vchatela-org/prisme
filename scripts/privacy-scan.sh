privacy-scan: FAILED — $hits file(s) matched the deny-list.

This repository is public. Do not "just delete the file and commit": if it was
already pushed, the content stays in history and in every clone. See
docs/17-privacy.md §3 for what to do instead.

If a match is a false positive, narrow the pattern in $DENYLIST
or add a specific path to $IGNOREFILE — every ignore entry is a hole
in the control, so keep it minimal.
